                    It is often difficult to describe to those who live in a free society what life is like in an authoritarian 
                    regime. You don't know who to trust. You worry that you, your family, or your friends will be arrested and 
                    jailed without due process. The fear of political violence or death, whether through direct assassinations 
                    or targeted "accidents", is constant. Such was the case in Kenya, especially during the 1990s.
